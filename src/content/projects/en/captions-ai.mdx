## The Problem

Content creators spend significant time crafting captions for social media posts. Writing engaging, platform-specific captions at scale is tedious and repetitive, especially when you need variations for different platforms (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn).

## The Solution

Captions AI generates social media captions using **OpenAI's GPT models**, tailored to the platform, tone, and audience. Users upload an image or describe their content, and the AI produces multiple caption options instantly.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Platform Support** — Generate captions optimized for Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook
- **Tone Selection** — Choose from professional, casual, humorous, or inspirational tones
- **Hashtag Generation** — Automatically suggest relevant hashtags based on content
- **Caption Variations** — Generate multiple options to A/B test engagement
- **History** — Save and revisit previously generated captions

## Technical Decisions

The **OpenAI API** was the natural choice for text generation quality. I implemented prompt engineering techniques to ensure consistent, platform-appropriate output — for example, Twitter captions stay under 280 characters while Instagram captions can be longer and include emoji suggestions.

The frontend is a **React SPA** with a clean, minimal interface focused on the generation workflow. **Node.js** serves as the API layer, handling OpenAI requests and rate limiting.

## What I Learned

This project was my deep dive into **prompt engineering** — structuring prompts with examples, constraints, and formatting instructions to get reliable, high-quality output. I also learned about managing API costs and implementing caching strategies for similar requests.
