## The Problem

Building a modern e-commerce experience requires juggling many concerns: authentication, product management, cart state, payments, and responsive design. Most solutions either rely on heavy frameworks or sacrifice developer experience.

## The Solution

Spectrum Store is a full-featured e-commerce platform built from the ground up with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It combines server-side rendering for SEO with client-side interactivity for a smooth shopping experience.

### Key Features

- **Product Catalog** — Browse and search products with server-side filtering and pagination
- **JWT Authentication** — Secure login/register flow with token refresh and role-based access
- **Shopping Cart** — Persistent cart with optimistic updates and real-time price calculation
- **Responsive Design** — Fully mobile-first UI built with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Admin Dashboard** — Product CRUD, order management, and analytics overview

## Technical Decisions

I chose **Next.js App Router** for its hybrid rendering capabilities — product pages are statically generated at build time, while the cart and checkout flow run on the client for instant feedback. **JWT-based auth** was picked over session cookies for its stateless nature, which scales better with distributed deployments.

The UI layer uses **Shadcn UI** components for consistency and accessibility, customized with Tailwind CSS for the unique brand identity.

## What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of server-client architecture trade-offs, especially around when to render on the server vs. client. It also taught me how to handle complex state synchronization between the cart, authentication, and payment flow.
