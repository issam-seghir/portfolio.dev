## The Problem

Real-time communication platforms require handling complex challenges: WebSocket connections, message persistence, user presence, file uploads, and audio/video streaming — all while keeping the experience smooth and responsive.

## The Solution

This Discord clone replicates the core experience of Discord with **real-time messaging**, server/channel management, and direct messaging. Built with a modern stack that prioritizes performance and developer experience.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Messaging** — Instant message delivery via Socket.io with typing indicators
- **Server & Channels** — Create and manage servers with text, audio, and video channels
- **Direct Messages** — 1-on-1 conversations between members
- **Member Management** — Role system with kick/ban capabilities for server admins
- **File Sharing** — Upload and share images and PDFs with drag-and-drop support
- **Infinite Scroll** — Message history loads seamlessly as you scroll up

## Technical Decisions

**Socket.io** powers the real-time layer because of its automatic reconnection handling and room-based broadcasting, which maps perfectly to Discord's channel model. **Prisma** with PostgreSQL handles the relational data — messages, users, servers, and channels have complex relationships that a relational database models naturally.

I used **Next.js API routes** as the backend, keeping the entire stack in one repository for easier development and deployment. The client-side state management uses React Query for server state and Zustand for UI state.

## What I Learned

Building this project taught me the intricacies of WebSocket scaling, managing connection state across browser tabs, and designing database schemas for hierarchical data (servers > channels > messages > replies).
