## The Problem

Most chat applications either lack real-time responsiveness or don't work well across platforms. Building a native-quality chat experience that works on both iOS and Android with a single codebase is a significant technical challenge.

## The Solution

Chat Whizz is a mobile chat application built with **React Native** and **Firebase**, delivering a smooth, native-feeling experience on both platforms. It features instant messaging, push notifications, and user presence detection.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Messaging** — Instant message delivery powered by Firebase Realtime Database
- **Push Notifications** — Background notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **User Presence** — See who's online with real-time status indicators
- **Image Sharing** — Send photos with compression and progressive loading
- **Group Chats** — Create and manage group conversations with admin controls
- **Message Status** — Read receipts and delivery confirmations

## Technical Decisions

**Firebase** was the backbone for real-time data sync and authentication — its offline-first architecture means messages are available even without internet, and they sync automatically when connectivity returns. **Redux** manages the application state, with persistence for offline support.

I chose **Expo** for the build toolchain because it dramatically simplifies the development-to-deployment pipeline, especially for push notifications which are notoriously complex to configure manually on each platform.

## What I Learned

This project deepened my mobile development skills significantly. I learned about the nuances of React Native performance optimization (FlatList virtualization, image caching), push notification architectures, and the challenges of maintaining feature parity across iOS and Android.
