## My Story

I started coding in my teens — what began as curiosity about how websites work quickly turned into a deep passion for building software. Today, I'm a Software Engineer based in Algeria, working as a freelancer to help startups and businesses turn ideas into production-ready products.

Over the years, I've shipped **ERP systems**, **AI-powered applications**, **SaaS platforms**, and **e-commerce solutions** — always with a focus on performance, accessibility, and clean architecture. Whether it's a landing page or a full-stack platform, I care about every pixel and every millisecond.

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about the intersection of **design and engineering**. I love turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. I care about developer experience as much as user experience — because good tooling leads to good products.
