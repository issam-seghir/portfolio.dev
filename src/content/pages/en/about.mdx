## My Story

I started coding as a teenager — what began as curiosity about how websites work quickly became an obsession with building them. I taught myself web development alongside my computer science studies, and within a few years I was shipping real products for real users.

At 25, I'm a Software Engineer, SaaS Founder, and freelancer with **4+ years of hands-on experience**. I've built everything from enterprise **ERP systems** to **AI-powered SaaS platforms**, **e-commerce solutions**, and **cross-platform mobile apps**. I don't just write code — I design, architect, and ship products that people actually use.

What makes me different? I think like a **founder** and create like a **designer**. Every project I touch gets obsessive attention to UI/UX, performance (90-100 Lighthouse scores), and architecture. I quit my job after three months because I wanted to build on my own terms — and I haven't looked back since.

## What Drives Me

I'm not just a developer — I'm a **creative problem-solver** with a background in art, writing, and design. I was drawing, writing poetry, and creating stories long before I wrote my first line of code. That creative DNA shapes everything I build.

I care about **impact at scale**. I chose software engineering because it lets me combine technical skill with creative expression to build things that help as many people as possible. Every pixel matters. Every millisecond matters. Every user interaction matters.

When I'm not shipping code, you'll find me exploring open-source projects, studying system design, or sketching UI concepts that push boundaries.
