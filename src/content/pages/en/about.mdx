## My Story

I started coding in my teens — what began as curiosity about how websites work quickly turned into a deep passion for building software. Today, I'm a Software Engineer based in Algeria, working as a freelancer to help startups and businesses turn ideas into production-ready products.

Over the years, I've shipped **ERP systems**, **AI-powered applications**, **SaaS platforms**, and **e-commerce solutions** — always with a focus on performance, accessibility, and clean architecture. Whether it's a landing page or a full-stack platform, I care about every pixel and every millisecond.

## What I Bring to the Table

I work across the entire stack. Here's what I specialize in:

**Frontend & Mobile**
Building fast, responsive, and beautiful user interfaces with **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn UI**. For mobile, I use **React Native** and **Expo** to ship cross-platform apps for both iOS and Android.

**Backend & APIs**
Designing scalable server-side architectures with **Node.js**, **Express**, **Python**, and **FastAPI**. I build robust REST and tRPC APIs that handle real-world traffic.

**Database & Infrastructure**
Working with **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **Prisma**, **Drizzle**, **Supabase**, and **Firebase**. I set up **Docker** containers, **CI/CD pipelines**, and deploy to **Vercel**, **Netlify**, and **Cloudflare**.

**AI Integration**
Collaborating with AI engineers to build applications leveraging **LLMs** and **AI APIs**, integrating intelligent features into products to solve real problems.

## How I Work

I believe great software is a blend of craft and communication. Here's my process:

1. **Understand** — I dig into the problem, the users, and the business goals before writing a single line of code.
2. **Design** — I think in systems. Architecture decisions come before UI decisions.
3. **Build** — I write clean, typed, well-tested code. No shortcuts.
4. **Ship** — I optimize for performance, set up monitoring, and make sure deployments are smooth.
5. **Iterate** — Software is never done. I stay involved and improve things over time.

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about the intersection of **design and engineering**. I love turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. I care about developer experience as much as user experience — because good tooling leads to good products.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring open-source projects, reading about system design, or experimenting with new technologies.
